# Azure AI Evaluator — microservice

A single Azure Functions app that evaluates scraped jobs against a user's
resume. It is intentionally decoupled from the scraping pipeline and the
Next.js app:

```
Next.js app → POST /api/evaluate (this service) → 202
                └─ enqueues ONE message to the evaluator's OWN queue
                       └─ evaluateWorker (Service Bus queue trigger, same app)
                            └─ evaluateRun (in-process orchestrator)
                                 ├─ groups a run's jobs by keyword (search_key)
                                 ├─ creates an evaluation_runs row (one per keyword batch)
                                 ├─ per job: ONE LLM call → fit + score + reasons + cover letter
                                 │    └─ fit === true → second LLM call generates the tailored
                                 │       resume HTML → stored in `generated-resumes`
                                 └─ writes fit / fit_score / fit_reasons / cover_letter /
                                    resume_status back to each jobs row in Supabase, and sets
                                    pipeline_runs.evaluation_status = completed
```

## Queues: three independent concerns (no function-to-function calls)

The evaluator owns its own Service Bus namespace with **three queues**, so
each concern scales, retries, and fails independently:

| Queue                   | Producer                  | Consumer            | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `evaluation-requests`   | `evaluate` (HTTP)         | `evaluateWorker`    | Per-job AI fit scoring (fan-out, 1 msg/job) |
| `resume-requests`       | `generateDocument` (HTTP) | `resumeWorker`      | On-demand tailored resume for ONE job       |
| `cover-letter-requests` | `generateDocument` (HTTP) | `coverLetterWorker` | On-demand cover letter for ONE job          |

- `POST /api/evaluate` validates the run, enqueues **ONE message per job** to
  `evaluation-requests`, and returns **202**. `evaluateWorker` scores each
  job (fit + score + reasons). When a job is a **fit**, the worker ALSO
  enqueues **one message to the `resume-requests` queue and one to the
  `cover-letter-requests` queue** — so both documents are auto-generated, but
  by their OWN dedicated Azure Functions (independently + in parallel). No-fit
  jobs enqueue nothing (one small call, no documents).
- `POST /api/documents/generate` with `{ jobId, userId, type }` lets the user
  (re)generate a tailored resume OR cover letter **on demand** for any job. It
  verifies the job belongs to `userId`, marks the artifact `building`
  (durable across refresh), and enqueues ONE message to that artifact's queue.
  The `resumeWorker` / `coverLetterWorker` consume it independently.
- **Durability**: status lives in Supabase (`resume_status` /
  `cover_letter_status`). If the user refreshes the page mid-generation, the
  detail page re-reads `building` and shows "Generating…" — the queue
  message is already durable, so the build continues server-side.
- **Security**: every HTTP trigger + worker verifies ownership via
  `.eq("user_id", userId)` on every query/update. RLS on `jobs` +
  `generated_resumes` additionally protects the browser/Realtime path.

This respects the **separate-queues model**: the **scraper** owns its queues in
`backend-scraping-api/azure/functions`; the **evaluator** owns its own separate
queues for evaluation + resume + cover letter. Both are plain Azure **Storage
Queues** ($0) living in their own Function App's `AzureWebJobsStorage`. Service
Bus (~$10/mo) and Event Hubs (~$11/mo) were both retired so the stack has zero
recurring messaging cost.

- **Live state over WebSocket**: at each progress point (start, per-job,
  completion, document done) the evaluator POSTs to the backend Express app's
  `/webhook/state` endpoint (`lib/socket.ts`), which pushes a `stats` event
  to the user's socket.io room. Supabase Realtime is the fallback for
  individual row changes (fit columns, resume_status, cover_letter_status).
- **Independent scaling** is preserved: the evaluator is still a separate
  deployable app, so slow/expensive LLM calls never block scraping.
- **Cost control** stays: one LLM call per job for scoring; one call per
  requested resume; one call per requested cover letter.

## Data written back (per job)

**Evaluation** (`evaluateWorker`):

- `fit`, `fit_score` (0–100), `fit_reasons`, `not_fit_reasons`, `justification`
- `expected_salary`
- `status` → `analysed`
- For FIT jobs: enqueues `resume-requests` + `cover-letter-requests`
  (auto-generation via the dedicated workers below).

**Tailored resume** (`resumeWorker` — auto for fit, or on demand):

- `resume_status` → `building → completed | failed`
- `resume_url` / `resume_file_name` / `resume_error`
- HTML uploaded to the `generated-resumes` bucket, tracked in `generated_resumes`

**Cover letter** (`coverLetterWorker` — auto for fit, or on demand):

- `cover_letter_status` → `building → completed | failed`
- `cover_letter` (the letter text) / `cover_letter_error`

Progress is written to `evaluation_runs` (one row per keyword batch) and the
overall evaluation state is reflected on `pipeline_runs.evaluation_status`
(`none → queued → evaluating → completed / failed`).
